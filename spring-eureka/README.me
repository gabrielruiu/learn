How to extend microservices to register themselves to a central registry.
This gives the advantage of enabling client-side load balancing and service providers from consumers
without the need for DNS.

TODO: I've dockerized both the client and server, but when I run the client, it's trying to connect to the registry on localhost:8761, but it's running in a different container, so it's failing. Need to somehow provide the clients with the address to the registry.
